Sub project of the Business Workflow ecosystem. BWF Forms provides a plugin where users can create, modify and publish Dynamic Forms, which may later be reused by plugins inside **BWF Components**. 

The project has its own _urls.py_ config and should be included in the host Django project. 

### Models

**BWForm**
Stores the main information about a form and holds a reference to its active version via the attribute _version_id_.

**BWFFormVersion**
Stores a file that keeps the JSON-object generated by the form builder. Similar to **BWF Workflow** only one of the child versions of a form can have an _active_ state. 

This object should be retrieved by its _version_id_ attribute, to avoid confusions with the Form Id and Version Id, as they are only integers. 

### Form Builder
Form builder is a jQuery plugin that has the capability of creating a form, and rendering it for the end user to fill in. 

#### Development

#### Building
